I took my website and consolidated all of the sections onto one page. With javascript and css I was able to create a static menu that changes color when you scroll down, and I took the static javascript button which allows you to click and scroll to the top of the page from the portfolio page on my last site and brought it over to the homepage on this website. I also incorporated a section with a contact form which brings you to a new page that automatically redirects you back after two seconds.
